"""Metrics to compare a pair of rankings or partial rankings.

Average overlap:
The metric is calculated by averaging the size of the overlaps between the
first k elements of predicted rankings and rankings divided by k,
(size of the overlap at k) / k, where k goes from 1 to maximum length,
specified by `max_lengths`. If maximum length is 0, we return 0.

  P(.) - Partial ranking (permutation) matrix corresponding to the given partial
    ranking.

  The partial average overlap of a partial ranking with itself is not
  necessarily 1. This makes the metric difficult to interpret, which is why we
  apply normalization as shown above (when `normalize` is set to True), which is
  similar to the normalization of the correlation coefficient.

  The calculation of partial average overlap differs from average overlap in the
  calculation of the ranking matrix. The partial ranking matrix is a permutation
  matrix to express ranking with ties. The entry {i, j} in the matrix represents
  the weight of class j being in place i in the ranking.

  The `predicted_rankings` and `rankings` are expected to give an ordering of
  all the classes 0, 1, 2, ... n as integers in which each class occurs exactly
  once.

  The groups provide information about ties in the ranking. For example if we
  have a ranking [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and groups [0, 1, 1, 1, -1] indicates that
  there is a tie between classes 1, 2 and 3. -1 indicates an unranked group
  which must be last.

  Note that if either predicted ranking or ranking is empty (groups contain only
  -1) the method returns 0.

    predicted_rankings: The predicted ranking with shape (num_examples,
      num_classes).
    predicted_groups: The predicted ranking groups with shape (num_examples,

    rankings: Ranking with shape (num_examples, num_classes).
