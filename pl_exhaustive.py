"""Computing Plackett-Luce loglikelihood given multiple partial rankings using the exhaustive approach.

Plackett-Luce model is a distribution on permutations based on sampling
without replacement.

If there are J items, the first item s(1) is selected with probability
proportional to lambda_j where
Pr[s(1) = j] = lambda_j/Z

with Z = lambda_1 + lambda_2 + .. + lambda_J

Then, the second item is chosen by excluding the first item with probability

Pr[s(2) = j | s(1)] = [j != s(1)] * lambda_j/(Z - lambda_{s(1)})

and so forth.

A differential diagnosis (ddx) is a collection of partial rankings provided by
several readers by ranking several conditions.

Terminology:

Even though the concept "partial ranking" actually subsumes any tied ranking,
including an untied top-k ranking (since the remaining L-k items can be
considered to be tied), we will be overloading this term with the following
definitions for the sake of convenience:

Full ranking: An untied ranking of all L options.
Partial ranking: A ranking of all L options that contains ties.
Full top-k ranking: A top-k ranking that does not contain ties.
Partial top-k ranking: A top-k ranking that contains ties within the top-k.

Within the code, normalized probabilities are denoted by `theta`, unnormalized
probabilities are denoted by `lam` (standing for lambda), and normalized or
unnormalized log-probabilities are denoted by `phi`.

This module includes the implementation of an exhaustive approach.
