"""Utilities for evaluation and certainty computation with plausibilities.

In our setting, (normalized) plausibilities represent categorical distributions
over classes. Sampling multiple plausibilities per case allows us to quantify
the annotation uncertainty, i.e., the impact of disagreement among
annotations on, e.g., the ranking or top-k classes. We generally assume
the plausibilities to not exhibit ties; if this is the case, we assume
that ties are resolved randomly before using the utilities in this file,
especially when computing certainties.
